# specky-ears-validator.sh — Validate EARS pattern compliance

# Paper: arXiv:2601.03878 — EARS quality

# Advisory hook: missing EARS pattern types WARN but exit 0 — exit 1 is
# reserved for real failures (SPECIFICATION.md missing or unreadable).
# Body is POSIX-sh compatible (runs under dash/sh as well as bash), so
# plain `set -eu` instead of bash-only `set -o pipefail`.
